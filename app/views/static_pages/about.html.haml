    Welcome to
    %a{:href => "http://www.beta.digitalnz.org"} beta.digitalnz.org

    you can browse, search, and discover New Zealand archives, photos, artworks, artefacts, data, news reports, and many other types of material, from nearly 200 organisations. But we also have a number of other exciting services planned.

      %a{:href => "http://www.digitalnz.org"} digitalnz.org
    Our approach to this is a little different because we are developing beta.digitalnz.org iteratively. That means we’re starting with a very basic version of the website and we’ll regularly make both small and substantial changes to this website throughout 2016 and beyond. These changes will often be based on your feedback, so any thoughts you have for us are hugely helpful and will feed directly into the site’s development.
