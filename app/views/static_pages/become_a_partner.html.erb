    <h1>Become a Partner</h1>

    <p>To become a contributor to this pilot website you will need to have digital items from your collection online so we can point to them, alternatively you may be planning a digitisation project that we can discuss with you.</p>

    <p>The following information provides an overview of how we can work with you. It is important that you also read and understand the <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org.nz/about/terms-of-use/metadata-contribution-terms">Metadata Contribution Terms</a> we will provide to you, as partners of this service will need to agree to the sharing of their descriptive metadata. This agreement is modelled on the <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org.nz/about/terms-of-use/metadata-contribution-terms">Metadata Contribution Terms</a> agreement used by the National Library of New Zealand’s DigitalNZ service.</p>

    <p>Being part of this pilot project means that the National Library Board of Singapore (NLB):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Will harvest, copy & cache your metadata, including small thumbnails, so it can be made accessible and searchable on the pilot platform.</li>
        <li>NLB may make larger sized thumbnails so your items display attractively on the pilot platform.</li>
        <li>Your metadata can be made available via the pilot platform API (use of which is subject to the <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org.nz/about/terms-of-use/developer-api-terms-of-use">Developer API</a> Terms modelled on the National Library of New Zealand’s DigitalNZ service).</li>
        <li>Your metadata may be cached for up to 30 days by users of the pilot platform API.</li>
        <li>Your metadata cannot be used for commercial purposes without your permission.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>NLB will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide clear attribution of your items (displaying the source and the URL of each item) on the pilot platform.</li>
        <li>Promptly remove your metadata from the pilot platform website at your request.</li>
        <li>Give you 30 days notice of any changes to the Metadata Contributor Terms.</li>
    </ul>
